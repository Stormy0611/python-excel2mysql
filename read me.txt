I need to upgrade the code i am using with folium + openroute service API with data from an excel. But since it will be always from the same excel spreadsheet, i need to create a database and update it, only the field that changed (to save for example calculaitons of distances. 2000 locations, so 2000x2000 are a lot of distances to compute.). I need it to be done much more professionally that i would do it and have access to everything for minor revisions i could decide to do later. on the folium output i attach, you cansee that pins have different colors based on when the next visit is due and popo up text have data of the location (GPS coors, name, phone etc) Please let me know.
